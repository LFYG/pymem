# pymem
Proof of concept python module for read/write to process memory<br>

Abstracts and simplifies the use of win32 api<br><br>
In order to read and write memory of processes<br>
Python programs that import pymem need to be run with Administrator privileges<br>
This limitation does not have a workaround currently<br>
<br>
Full Docstring documentation coming soonâ„¢....
